# Master Thesis â€“ Generic Product Clustering

This repo contains my master thesis written at the [University of Applied Sciences in Erfurt](https://www.ai.fh-erfurt.de/) in cooperation with [adesso SE Jena](https://www.adesso.de/).

## Overview

The goal is to find an efficient and generic way to cluster product data as provided by typical Product Information Management (PIM) Systems. As an example, the open-source solution [Akeneo PIM](https://www.akeneo.com/de/akeneo-pim-community-edition/) was used with data from the [Open Icecat Catalog](https://icecat.biz/).

## Project Structure

- `akeneo-pim/` contains an installation of Akeneo PIM Community Edition version 5.0.
- `cluster-analysis/` is the main directory of the clustering implementation and analysis.
- `thesis/` holds the actual master thesis as it was handed in.
